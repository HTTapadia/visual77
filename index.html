        <p>Visual Studio Code is a brilliant coding software in which you can develop games, apps, websites and everything and anything you can imagine. It is an IDE software in which you can use CSS, Javascript and Html. Brackets is another alternative however Visual Studio Code is more advanced and easier to access. With many extensions to add and libraries, you can optimize the use of Visual Studio Code at your own preference. </p>

        <h1>Console</h1>
<p>The console is a screen where you can view data before displaying it on the webpage. Most of the times, you can press ctrl+shift+i to access the inspect section, followed by the console screen. For now, I'll leave a few operations and names for you to view on the console screen! Enjoy!! </p>

        <script>
            var firstname = "Grover";
            console.log (firstname);

            var lastname = "Underwood";
            console.log (lastname);

            var fullname = firstname.concat(lastname);
            console.log;

            var a = 15;
            var b = 5;

            var add = a+b;
            console.log (add);

            var sub = a-b;
            console.log (sub);

            var times = a*b;
            console.log (times);

            var divide = a/b;
            console.log (divide);
